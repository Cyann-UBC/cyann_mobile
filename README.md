# cyann_mobile

##Intro
This is this repository for Cyann's mobile app power by [Cyann's backend](https://github.com/Cyann-UBC/Cyann)
Please follow the step in the backend to build and run the server on your localhost:8080

##How to build?
###due to the framework's complex nature, we have a lot to go over, this guide will walk you through the steps
First, follow [this](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) guild to setup react-native and npm on your computer.

After you've done that, do the following

###Facebook SDK
Because the mobile app uses Facebook SDK to handle user login, you will have to download Facebook SDK [here](Download the SDK)

On your computer, create a new folder called "FacebookSDK" under your ~/Documents

unzip the the Facebook SDK you just downloaded

and drag the following files to ~/Documents/FacebookSDK

this step is crucial, or the build will fail
```
Bolts.framework
FBSDKCoreKit.framework
FBSDKLoginKit.framework
FBSDKShareKit.framework
```

###NPM dependencies

then clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Cyann-UBC/cyann_front

navigate to the folder
```
cd cyann_mobile

install dependencies
```

then start building the project
